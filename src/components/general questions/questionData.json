        "questionData":"What is async-await?",
        "answerData": "async-await is a syntax in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. The async keyword declares an asynchronous function, and await pauses the function execution until a promise is resolved, making asynchronous code easier to read and write."

    {
        "questionData":"What is a promise?",
        "answerData": "A promise in JavaScript represents an operation that hasn't completed yet but is expected in the future. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Promises allow for handling asynchronous operations and chaining multiple asynchronous calls."
